1. Roles and Responsibilities:
Question: How have my roles and responsibilities evolved since joining the team? Have I taken on additional responsibilities beyond my original scope?
Your Response:
Since joining, I've been heavily involved in delivering key user stories, handling 60-80% of the workload. This is a significant portion compared to what was expected. While I understand the need to support the team, the current distribution of work doesn't reflect the level of involvement I anticipated for this role. Additionally, the team lacks experience in certain areas, and the manager has requested feedback on their performance, which adds to my responsibilities. However, I have primarily focused on my own metrics and contributions.
2. Career Growth:
Question: How do my current responsibilities align with my long-term career goals? Am I gaining the skills and knowledge needed for future growth?
Your Response:
While I’ve gained functional knowledge related to the client, I see limited growth in technical areas. The project has offered about 30-40% of the learning opportunities that would benefit my career progression. I believe that while I’m managing well within the "as-is" model, there’s little scope for me to develop technically beyond this point, which is a concern for my long-term career growth.
3. Engagement Model:
Question: Is the current engagement model effective for both myself and the team? Should there be adjustments to improve the team’s overall efficiency?
Your Response:
From the start, I've been instructed to work independently, and my responsibilities have not officially included leading the team. Nevertheless, I’ve supported the team multiple times, even though my manager has asked me not to get involved with other user stories. My concern is that the team, overall, operates at a lower efficiency rate compared to what’s expected. While I’ve been able to manage my tasks efficiently, it’s clear that there are gaps in the team’s technical knowledge, which can affect our overall delivery.
4. Value Proposition:
Question: Am I delivering value that aligns with the expectations of my role, and is this value being recognized?
Your Response:
I’ve experienced a burn rate of 4.5 times the expected workload, managing both my user stories and assisting others. While this demonstrates my dedication, it also raises concerns about sustainability. I feel that my contributions exceed what’s expected, and if I were to work solely on my assigned Jira stories like others, I could maintain the same level of delivery without taking on extra work. I believe there’s a need to balance the workload more effectively across the team.
5. Path Forward:
Question: What adjustments can be made moving forward to ensure both my career growth and job satisfaction?
Your Response:
If the current engagement model doesn’t offer opportunities for career growth or adequate monetary compensation, I may have to consider other opportunities. Moving forward, I intend to be more selective in responding to team requests and prioritize my own technical skill development. I would also appreciate any guidance or support in creating opportunities to further enhance my skills within this project.
